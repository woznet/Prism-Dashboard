## What is Prism?

Prism is a modern, responsive Home Assistant dashboard with a glassmorphism design.  
It combines semi-transparent "frosted glass" surfaces with neumorphism elements for haptic feedback and uses smart YAML anchors to keep the code lean, consistent, and easy to maintain.

Prism is optimized for wall tablets and smartphones and is ideal as a central smart home hub for everyday use.

> **📝 Note:** The dashboard configuration (YAML) was completely hand-written by me.  
> The custom JavaScript cards were developed with AI assistance (Cursor AI).

## Features

- **💎 Glassmorphism UI**  
  Semi-transparent "Frosted Glass" cards with blur effects for a modern, premium look.

- **👆 Haptic Feedback (Neumorphism)**  
  Active buttons appear "pressed" and provide visual feedback on interactions.

- **🧭 Smart Navigation**  
  Animated navigation bar that automatically highlights the current room or active view.

- **🌈 Status Glow**  
  Icons glow in appropriate colors depending on state (e.g., green for security, orange for heating).

- **📱 Responsive Grid**  
  Layout seamlessly adapts to different devices (tablet on the wall, smartphone in hand).

- **🧹 Clean Code with YAML Anchors**  
  Uses YAML anchors (`&` and `*`) to avoid repetition and keep global style changes centralized.

---

## Requirements

For this dashboard to work, the following frontend integrations must be installed via **HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)**:

- **Mushroom Cards**  
  Base for almost all cards in the dashboard.

- **card-mod**  
  Essential for CSS and glassmorphism styling.

- **layout-card**  
  Enables the responsive grid layout (sidebar + main area).

- **kiosk-mode**  
  Hides Home Assistant header and sidebar for a clean fullscreen look.

- **mini-graph-card**  
  Required for the temperature graph in the sidebar (`prism-sidebar` and `prism-sidebar-light`). The sidebar uses mini-graph-card to display accurate temperature history graphs matching Home Assistant's native graph style.

- **browser_mod**  
  Important for popups (e.g., calendar, vacuum control).

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Installation via HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) is installed.
2. Go to **HACS → Frontend** (three-dot menu top right) → **Custom Repositories**
3. Add this repository:
   - **Repository:** `https://github.com/Woznet/Prism-Dashboard`
   - **Type:** `Dashboard`
4. Search for "Prism Dashboard" and click **"Download"**
5. Restart Home Assistant

> **✨ That's it!** HACS automatically registers the resource. All 29 custom cards (dark + light themes) are included in this single file and will receive automatic cache updates via HACS.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Copy the contents of the `www` folder to your Home Assistant configuration folder under  
   `/config/www/`.  
3. The background image should then be accessible at  
   `/local/background/background.png`.  
4. **Note:** Restart Home Assistant if the `www` folder was newly created or newly added.

### 2. Create Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Settings → Dashboards** in Home Assistant.  
2. Click **"Add Dashboard"** → Select **"New Dashboard from Scratch"**.  
3. Make the following settings:
   - **Title:** `Prism` (or a title of your choice)
   - **View Type:** `Grid (layout-card)` (if available, otherwise define it later in the code)

> **Note:** For dashboard configuration and adjustments, see [Dashboard Configuration](#dashboard-configuration) and [Dashboard README](dashboard/README.md).

### 3. Register Custom Cards (Manual Installation Only)

If you chose Option 2 (manual installation), the custom cards must be registered manually:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Dashboards** in Home Assistant.  
2. Click **"Resources"** (top right).  
3. Click **"Add Resource"**.  
4. Add the bundled resource:
   - **URL:** `/local/custom-components/prism-dashboard.js`  
   - **Type:** `JavaScript Module`
5. Restart Home Assistant so the custom cards are loaded.

> **✨ All 29 cards are included!** The bundled file contains all dark and light theme cards.
